# Understanding-Clustering
An Intuitive Approach to Understanding K - Means Clustering

This project is to reinforce my understanding of K-means' underlying theory by demonstrating its effect when applied to a photograph. 

# Modeling objective
This notebook uses K-means to cluster the pixels of a photograph of some tulips based on their encoded color values. This notebook explores how different values of k affect the clustering of the pixels, and thus the appearance of the photograph.
